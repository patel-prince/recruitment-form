# Quick Email Setup - Step by Step

## Why you're not receiving emails:
The email service is configured but needs your EmailJS credentials. Currently it's using placeholder values.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup (5 minutes):

### Step 1: Create EmailJS Account
1. Go to **https://www.emailjs.com/**
2. Click **"Sign Up"** (it's free)
3. Use your Gmail: `quake.patel@gmail.com`
4. Verify your email

### Step 2: Add Gmail Service
1. In EmailJS dashboard, click **"Email Services"**
2. Click **"Add New Service"**
3. Choose **"Gmail"**
4. Click **"Connect Account"**
5. Sign in with your Gmail account
6. **Copy the Service ID** (looks like: `service_abc123`)

### Step 3: Create Email Template
1. Click **"Email Templates"**
2. Click **"Create New Template"**
3. **Subject:** `New Recruitment Form - {{from_name}}`
4. **Content:** Copy this exactly:

```
Hello,

You have received a new recruitment form submission:

Name: {{from_name}}
Email: {{from_email}}
Phone: {{phone}}

Full Details:
{{message}}

Best regards,
Recruitment System
```

5. Click **"Save"**
6. **Copy the Template ID** (looks like: `template_xyz789`)

### Step 4: Get Public Key
1. Click **"Account"** â†’ **"General"**
2. **Copy your Public Key** (looks like: `user_abc123def456`)

### Step 5: Update Your Code
Open `src/services/emailService.ts` and replace these 3 lines:

```typescript
const EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID = 'service_abc123'; // Replace with your Service ID
const EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID = 'template_xyz789'; // Replace with your Template ID  
const EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY = 'user_abc123def456'; // Replace with your Public Key
```

### Step 6: Test It!
1. Save the file
2. Submit your recruitment form
3. Check your email!

## ðŸ”§ Alternative: Use Formspree (Even Easier)

If EmailJS seems complicated, try Formspree:

### Step 1: Go to Formspree
1. Visit **https://formspree.io/**
2. Sign up with your Gmail
3. Create a new form
4. **Copy the form URL** (looks like: `https://formspree.io/f/xpzgkqwe`)

### Step 2: Update Code
In `src/services/emailService.ts`, find this line:
```typescript
const webhookUrl = 'https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID';
```
Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual form ID.

### Step 3: Use Webhook Method
In `src/firebase/formService.ts`, change this line:
```typescript
// Change from:
const emailResult = await sendFormSubmissionEmail(formData as EmailData);

// To:
const emailResult = await sendEmailViaWebhook(formData as EmailData);
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Which option should you choose?

- **EmailJS**: More customizable, professional templates
- **Formspree**: Simpler setup, works immediately

Both are free and will work with your current setup!

## ðŸ†˜ Still having issues?

1. Check browser console for errors (F12 â†’ Console)
2. Make sure you copied the IDs correctly
3. Try the Formspree option if EmailJS doesn't work

Your form is ready - it just needs the email service credentials!
